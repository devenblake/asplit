.SH DESCRIPTION
Prints the span of text between and excluding occurrences SELECTION-1 and SELECTION of STRING in each line from standard input.

With no SELECTION, prints the amount of times STRING occurs in each line.
.SH BUGS
If SELECTION isn't a natural number it'll be interpreted as 0.

When a line is received that exceeds the maximum characters asplit can handle, asplit will print a warning message to standard error.
